# A Story to Engage
Using a story is one of the easiest and most effective ways to help your audience remember the facts and information that you want them to take away from your presentation. Think of a story as the coat rack that you organize and hang the information you want your audience to remember and use.

## Story Tips
Just a reminder of things to keep in mind as you pull together your story:
- Know your audience:
- Start with a big idea or something counterintuitive
- Tell a personal story (or someone else's personal story)
- Show don't tell
- Build up to a S.T.A.R. moment (Something They'll Always Remember)
- End with a positive takeaway or call to action
