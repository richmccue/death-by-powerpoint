# A Story to Engage
<a href="" target="_blank"><img src="images/book-lights.jpg" style="float:right;width:330px;" alt="Book with twinkle lights representing creativity"></a>
Using a story is one of the easiest and most effective ways to help your audience remember the facts and information that you want them to take away from your presentation. Think of a story as the coat rack that you organize and hang the information you want your audience to remember and use.

## Story Tips
Just a reminder of things to keep in mind as you pull together your story:
- Know your audience:
- Start with a big idea or something counterintuitive
- Tell a personal story (or someone else's personal story)
- Show don't tell
- Build up to a S.T.A.R. moment (Something They'll Always Remember)
- End with a positive takeaway or call to action

## Story for the Makerspace Badging Paper
It wasn't easy to come up with a memorable personal story about [Makerspace Workshop Badges](images/makerspace-badge-paper.pdf){:target="_blank"} until I thought back to what prompted me to start a Bading pilot project. Here are the key elements of the origin story of Makerspace Badges in the Digital Scholarship Commons:

> - Not long after we opened our library makerspace, two mechanical engineers took our Electronics with Arduino workshop.
> - After completing the workshop they asked if they could have a certificate they could put on their resume to let employers know that they not only do they know about mechanical engineering but also have some experience with electronics.
> - Within a week Iâ€™d started our Digital Badging Pilot project I sent the two engineering students Makerspace Badges that they could cite on their resumes.
> - Since then our makerspace, has issued over 1,500 workshop badges.
> - Informal feedback from students has been very positive.

Next, we will use these key points to tell a short story at the beginning of our presentation to set the stage for the important information to follow.
