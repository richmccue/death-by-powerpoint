# Death by PowerPoint -or- Persuasive Presentations?

- Pre-workshop activities: 30 min 
- Introductory presentation: 10 min
- Hands-on activities: 90 min

## Creating Pursuasive & Engaging Presentations 

We have all been there before… In a class or a meeting, the presenter reads text off of densely packed PowerPoint slide after slide. If it isn’t death by PowerPoint, reading text off [poorly constructed slides](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/slideshow/366369/world-worst-powerpoint-presentations/){:target="_blank"} to an audience is a very ineffective way to teach or convey information in a business setting. 

In this workshop, we’re going to focus on learning and using tips and tricks so your presentations engage and persuade, and not bore your audience to death by PowerPoint.
