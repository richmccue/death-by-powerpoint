## Creating Pursuasive & Engaging Presentations 

We have all been there before… In a class or a meeting, the presenter is reading text off of densely packed PowerPoint slide after slide. If it isn’t death by PowerPoint, reading text off [poorly constructed slides](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/slideshow/366369/world-worst-powerpoint-presentations/){:target="_blank"} to an audience is a very ineffective way to teach or convey information in a business setting. This week we’re going to focus on learning tips and tricks so your presentations engage and persuade, and not bore your audience to death by PowerPoint.
