# Record Your Presentation

Please record your presentation using Zoom:
- Start a Zoom call just for yourself
- Share your screen (but not video)
- Start recording your presentation (using Zoom)
- Stop recording when you're done and after you end the Zoom call, Zoom will generate a video of your presentation that you can share if you'd like.
