# Choosing a Topic & Identifying Key Points
## Choosing Your Topic
<img src="images/topic-01-article.png" style="float:right;width:330px;" alt="image description">
The topic you choose is completely up to you. If you have a topic in mind, or a presentaiton that you need to create, please go ahead and use the topic of your choice. If you don't have a topic in mind we will provide you with a published research paper and will lead you through the process of creating a presentation for it. The provided research paper is titled, _[Makerspace Workshop Badges: Student Perceptions & Uses of Informal Credentialing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10xUA9s71liGL4r5jfsEh56SGe2iO9Oqs/){:target="_blank"}_ [**UPDATE THIS LINK**].

It's even better if you have a topic of your own or a topic you are interested in, in which case please use the instructions for the provided research paper as guidlines as you create your own presentation. Here are some promptes that can assist you in selecting a presentation topic of your own (if you decide you would like to choose your own topic):
- Essay or research paper you have written
- Something that your are interested in (the environment, language revitalization, economic equality, etc.)
- Article you like from academic or popular media (E.g. [electric car batteries](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/are-electric-cars-really-better-for-the-environment/){:target="_blank"}, or [colonial place names](https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/renaming-places-how-canada-is-reexamining-the-map/){:target="_blank"})
- [Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
- [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/playlists/171/the_most_popular_talks_of_all){:target="_blank"} 

Please do not hesitate to ask the instructor leading the workshop if you have any questions, or would like feedback on your choice of topic.

## Time Contraints
You are usually given a maximim time for your presentations. In the case of provided Makerspace Workshop Badge paper, the conference where it is being presented has given a hard time limit of 10 minutes for the presentation. 
- How many sides for a 10 minute presentation? If you follow the guidelines in this workshop, you should allow for approximatly 30 seconds per slide. That would mean in the case of the provided research paper, limiting the number of slides to 20. 
- Once you've completed a first draft of the presentation you can time a practice presentation and see if it takes more or less than 10 minutes to present the slides.

## Know Your Audience

- The audience of university makerspace staff, but not education experts for the most part. Other audience considerations include age, interestes, cultural references, etc.
