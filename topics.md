# Choosing a Topic & Identifying Key Point

Choosing a topic is completely up to you of course. If you have a topic in mind, or a presentaiton that you need to create, please go ahead and use the topic of your choice. If you don't have a topic in mind we will provide you with a topic based on a published research paper and will lead you through the process of creating a presentation for it. It's even better if you have a topic of your own, in which case please use the instructions for the published research paper as guidlines as you create your own presentation. Please do not hesitate to ask the instructor leading the workshop if you have any questions, or would like feedback on what you have done so far.
