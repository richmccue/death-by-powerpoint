<img src="images/topic-01-article.png" style="float:right;width:330px;" alt="image description">
The topic you choose is completely up to you. If you have a topic in mind, or a presentaiton that you need to create, please go ahead and use the topic of your choice. 
### If You Don't Have a Topic
If you don't have a topic in mind we will provide you with a published research paper and will lead you through the process of creating a presentation for it. The provided research paper is titled, _[Makerspace Workshop Badges: Student Perceptions & Uses of Informal Credentialing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10xUA9s71liGL4r5jfsEh56SGe2iO9Oqs/){:target="_blank"}_ [**UPDATE THIS LINK**].
### If You Have a Topic
If you have a topic of your own or a topic you are interested in, please use the instructions for the provided research paper as guidlines to create your own presentation. If you would like to use your own topic, but don't have one selected yet, here are some promptes that can assist you:
- Essay or research paper you have written
- A Topic you are interested in (environment, language revitalization, economic equality, etc.)
- Article from academic or popular media (E.g. [electric car batteries](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/are-electric-cars-really-better-for-the-environment/){:target="_blank"}, or [colonial place names](https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/renaming-places-how-canada-is-reexamining-the-map/){:target="_blank"})
- [Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
- [TED Talks](https://www.ted.com/playlists/171/the_most_popular_talks_of_all){:target="_blank"} 

Please do not hesitate to ask the instructor leading the workshop if you have any questions, or would like feedback on your choice of topic.

## Identifying Key Points for Your Presentation
To identify the key points of the article or paper you will base your presentation on you may find it helpful to keep these two points in mind as you read through the document, and then hilight the passages that meet the criteria:
- **What are the most interesting facts or pieces of informaion in the document?** For example in the Makerspace Badging article, the methods section of the article really isn't that interesting to a general audience, but the _Results_ and _Discuission_ sections (and to a lesser extent the _Literature Review_) have interesting facts and take-a-ways.
- **What do you want someone who has finished reading the document to know?** For example...

If you are using the provided paper on Makerspace Badges to create your presentation, please review the PDF document with highlighted key points and information and pick out the

## Time Contraints
You are usually given a maximim time for your presentations. In the case of provided Makerspace Workshop Badge paper, the conference where it is being presented has given a hard time limit of 10 minutes for the presentation. 
- How many sides for a 10 minute presentation? If you follow the guidelines in this workshop, you should allow for approximatly 30 seconds per slide. That would mean in the case of the provided research paper, limiting the number of slides to 20. 
- Once you've completed a first draft of the presentation you can time a practice presentation and see if it takes more or less than 10 minutes to present the slides.

## Know Your Audience

- The audience of university makerspace staff, but not education experts for the most part. Other audience considerations include age, interestes, cultural references, etc.
