## Choosing Your Topic
<img src="images/topic-01-article.png" style="float:right;width:330px;" alt="image description">
The topic you choose is completely up to you, whether you have a topic already in mind, or would like to create a presentation with the provided research paper topic. 

### If You Have a Topic in Mind or Would Like Help Selecting a Topic
If you have a topic in mind, please use the instructions in the following workshop activities for the provided research paper as guidlines to create your own presentation. 

If you would like to use your own topic, but don't have one selected yet, or don't have a presentation that you need to create for a class or conference, here are some promptes that can assist you in selecting a topic that is of interest to you:
- An Essay or research paper you have written
- A Topic you are interested in (environment, language revitalization, economic equality, for example)
- An Article from a journal or popular media (for example: [electric car batteries](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/are-electric-cars-really-better-for-the-environment/){:target="_blank"}, or [colonial place names](https://canadiangeographic.ca/articles/renaming-places-how-canada-is-reexamining-the-map/){:target="_blank"})
- A [Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
- A [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/playlists/171/the_most_popular_talks_of_all){:target="_blank"} 

### If You Don't Have a Topic & Want to Use the Provided Paper
If you don't have a topic in mind we will provide you with a research paper and will lead you through the process of creating a presentation for it.

**At this point you should have decided on your presentation topic, or choosen to use the provided research paper below.**

## Identifying Key Points for Your Presentation
To identify the key points of the article or paper you will base your presentation on you may find it helpful to keep these two points in mind as you read through the document, and then hilight the passages that meet the criteria:
- **What are the most interesting facts or pieces of informaion in the document or topic?** For example in the Makerspace Badging article, the methods section of the article really isn't that interesting to a general audience, but the _Results_ and _Discuission_ sections (and to a lesser extent the _Literature Review_) have interesting facts and take-a-ways.
- **What do you want someone who has finished reading the document to know?** For example...

If you are using the provided paper on Makerspace Badges to create your presentation, please review the PDF document with highlighted key points and information and pick out the

Please do not hesitate to ask the instructor leading the workshop if you have any questions, or would like feedback on your choice of topic.

## Time Contraints
You are usually given a maximim time for your presentations. In the case of provided Makerspace Workshop Badge paper, the conference where it is being presented has given a hard time limit of 10 minutes for the presentation. 
- How many sides for a 10 minute presentation? If you follow the guidelines in this workshop, you should allow for approximatly 30 seconds per slide. That would mean in the case of the provided research paper, limiting the number of slides to 20. 
- Once you've completed a first draft of the presentation you can time a practice presentation and see if it takes more or less than 10 minutes to present the slides.

## Know Your Audience

- The audience of university makerspace staff, but not education experts for the most part. Other audience considerations include age, interestes, cultural references, etc.
