# Choosing a Topic & Identifying Key Points
## Choosing Your Topic
The topic you choose is completely up to you. If you have a topic in mind, or a presentaiton that you need to create, please go ahead and use the topic of your choice. If you don't have a topic in mind we will provide you with a published research paper and will lead you through the process of creating a presentation for it. The provided research paper is titled, _[Makerspace Workshop Badges: Student Perceptions & Uses of Informal Credentialing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10xUA9s71liGL4r5jfsEh56SGe2iO9Oqs/){:target="_blank"}_ [**UPDATE THIS LINK**].

It's even better if you have a topic of your own or a topic you are interested in, in which case please follow the instructions for the provided research paper as guidlines as you create your own presentation. Here are some promptes that hopefully will assist you in selecting a presentation topics (if you decide you would like to use your own topic):
- Essay or research paper you have written
- Something that your are interested in
- Article you like (academic or popular)
- [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank"}
- [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/playlists/171/the_most_popular_talks_of_all){:target="_blank"} 

Please do not hesitate to ask the instructor leading the workshop if you have any questions, or would like feedback on your choice of topic.
