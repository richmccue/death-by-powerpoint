## Can Death By PowerPoint Be Avoided?
By the end of this workshop you will be able to explain to your friends why reading densely packed PowerPoint slides is ineffective, along with why a number of other PowerPoint “sins” should be avoided if you want to make persuasive and memorable presentations. Let’s start to learn about some of these sins to avoid by watching an excellent TEDx video that tells some stories about awful PowerPoint slides and then models the use of several techniques, based on [multimedia learning principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TGVFG_iCc3iSz3aX3j8UC-YC63V__6tKFJQ4FtAsH4o/edit){:target="_blank"}, that we can use to make our presentations more engagning and persuasive.

- Here are some of the key takeaways from David Phillips excellent talk and the 6 dos and don’ts article:
  1. **Only 1 idea per slide** – Cognitive Load Theory
  2. **No more than 6 objects per slide** (including title and images) – Cognitive Load Theory
  3. **Don’t read text off your side**, let your audience read it – Redundancy Principle
  4. If in doubt **use an illustrative image and short text on a slide**, and then tell the rest of your story via narration – Multimedia & Modality Principles
  5. Make sure **the most prominent feature of each of your slides is also the most important** – Signalling Principle
  6. Make sure your slides **tell your story in a way that your audience can follow**
  7. **Vary the tone of your voice as you present**, and make sure to **pause at transition points** in your presentation, and after making an important point to emphasize it
  8. **Use san-serif fonts like Ariel or Helvetica** as they are easier to read on screens than serif fonts like Times New Roman
  9. **Use contrast to move your audience around the information on your slide** – Signalling & Coherence Principles

## Can Storytelling Make Your Presentation More Memorable?
Storytelling is a powerful teaching tool. That said, we should never forget to put related and well-constructed stories in our persuasive presentations. Note how Don McMillan, in the following video, tells a series of funny stories to help him make his key points memorable in his, _Life After Death by PowerPoint_ presentation.

Please skim over the Nayomi Chibana's article on storytelling techniques for presentations, and think of ways you could incorporate some of the techniques into the presentation you will make as part of this workshop: [7 Storytelling Techniques Used by the Most Inspiring TED Presenters](https://visme.co/blog/7-storytelling-techniques-used-by-the-most-inspiring-ted-presenters/){:target="_blank"}
- Below are the main points from Nayomi’s article on storytelling in presentations (make sure you read the above article if you haven’t already to get the details for each storytelling suggestion, including presentation video examples):
    1. Immerse your audience in a story
    2. Tell a personal story
    3. Create suspense
    4. Bring characters to life
    5. Show. Don’t tell
    6. Build up to a S.T.A.R. moment
    7. End with a positive takeaway

**OPTIONAL** - If you'd like to go deeper on public speaking, and explore whether or not you should be reading your presentations, or doing more ad libbing, listen to this wonderful podcast by Tim Harford while you go for a walk (or at your computer if you like). In this episode Tim tells two stories. The first is about a public speaking failure that ended the career of a business leader, and the second speech by Martin Luther King Jr. that has become one of the most famous in the English language. Tim is a wonderful storyteller, and these two stories are entertaining, engaging, and thought provoking. In short, this podcast is a great example of educational storytelling, and a wonderful learning object.
