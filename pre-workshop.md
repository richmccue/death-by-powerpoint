## How Can You Avoid Death by PowerPoint?
By the end of this workshop you will be able to explain to your friends why reading densely packed PowerPoint slides is ineffective, along with why a number of other PowerPoint “sins” should be avoided if you want to make persuasive and memorable presentations. Let’s start to learn about some of these sins to avoid by watching an excellent TEDx video that tells some stories about awful PowerPoint slides and then models the use of several techniques, based on [multimedia learning principles](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TGVFG_iCc3iSz3aX3j8UC-YC63V__6tKFJQ4FtAsH4o/edit){:target="_blank"}, that we can use to make our presentations persuasive and effective learning objects.

- Here are some of the key takeaways from David Phillips excellent talk and the 6 dos and don’ts article:
  1. **Only 1 idea per slide** – Cognitive Load Theory
  2. **No more than 6 objects per slide** (including title and images) – Cognitive Load Theory
  3. **Don’t read text off your side**, let your audience read it – Redundancy Principle
  4. If in doubt **use an illustrative image and short text on a slide**, and then tell the rest of your story via narration – Multimedia & Modality Principles
  5. Make sure **the most prominent feature of each of your slides is also the most important** – Signalling Principle
  6. Make sure your slides **tell your story in a way that your audience can follow**
  7. **Vary the tone of your voice as you present**, and make sure to **pause at transition points** in your presentation, and after making an important point to emphasize it
  8. **Use san-serif fonts like Ariel or Helvetica** as they are easier to read on screens than serif fonts like Times New Roman
  9. **Use contrast to move your audience around the information on your slide** – Signalling & Coherence Principles

## Storytelling & PowerPoint?
storytelling is a powerful teaching tool. That said, we should never forget to put related and well-constructed stories in our persuasive presentations. Note how Don McMillan, in the following video, tells a series of funny stories to help him make his key points memorable in his, _Life After Death by PowerPoint_ presentation.
