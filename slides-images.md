# Create Your Slides with Complementary Imagery

- Choosing your presentation platform. For example, you could use:
   - Microsoft PowerPoint
   - Google Presentation
   - Canva
   - Any other tool you like using.
- Label sections of your presentation:
   - Introduction
   - What are Digital Badges?
   - Why Use Badges?
   - How Many Badges Requested?
   - Are Badges Being Used?
   - Are Badges Helpful in Job Searches?
   - Conclusions
- Start creating 1 (or more slides) for each topic and key point you identified earlier
- Label each slide with some text (but not too much)
- Find (or create) images that help convey the message you want to communicate for each key point or topic using freely licensable tools like:
   - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/){:target="_blank"}
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/){:target="_blank"}
   - [CoPilot Image designer](https://www.bing.com/images/create?FORM=GENILP){:target="_blank"} (which is based on ChatGPT) for an AI-generated image

Here is an example of the final presentation for the research paper for a 10-minute presentation (not the 5-minute Presentation you're going to create)
