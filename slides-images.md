# Create Your Slides with Complementary Imagery

- Choosing your presentation platform:
- Label sections of your presentation:
- Start creating 1 (or more slides) for each topic and key point you identified earlier
- Label each slide with some text (but not too much)
- Find (or create) and image that helps convey the message you want to communicate for each key point or topic using freely licensable tools like:
   - [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/){:target="_blank"}
   - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/){:target="_blank"}
   - [CoPilot Image designer](https://www.bing.com/images/create?FORM=GENILP){:target="_blank"} (wich is based on ChatGPT) for an AI generated image
